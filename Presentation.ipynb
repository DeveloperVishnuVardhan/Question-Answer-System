    "### Reasons for selecting Bert model and not selecting models such as GPT and T5\n",
    "1. **Bidirectional Context:** Bert is designed to capture context in both left and right sides of the token, thus this bidirectional context in bert allows it to better understand the contextual relation between words in a sentence. As explained in Bert paper GPT process the text in uni-directional way which limits its ability to understand context in text and more suitable for text generation tasks. Although T5 is bi-directional it is not as optimized as bert for bidirectional context representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pre-training Objectives:** Masked Language Modelling and Next Sentence Prediction methods in Pre-training Bert makes Bert better understand language and context which is more useful for tasks like question answering while on contrast GPT uses a uni-directional modelling objective while T5 uses denoising autoencoder objective.\n"

    "* As we are dealing with Question-Answering which is just as same as classification predicting the first and last index of the answer in sentence but as per the Bert paper they used a slightly modified version of these metrics to evaluate their model.\n",
    "* Accuracy -> We evaluate Accuracy as follows we compute accuracy for both the first_index and last_index predictions.\n",
    "* Precision -> It is caluculated as (Number of correct tokens in the predicted answer) / (Total number of tokens in the predicted answer).\n",
    "* Recall -> It is caluculated as (Number of correct tokens in the predicted answer) / (Total number of tokens in the actual answer).\n",
    "* F1-score -> 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
